There once was a hippo named Tom. Tom enjoyed going camping. One day, Tom went camping, and was attacked by a mouse. Tom had to fight the mouse before he could start camping, which was very hard to do.
The mouse ran all over Tom, but tom was too big. The mouse tired out and gave up on attacking Tom. Tom continued on with his camping and ate s'mores.
He aslo prepared himself some icecream along with the s'mores.It was quite a contrast in his mouth with icy chocolates and hot s'mores. He was very confused.Later that night, it rained cats and dogs. Tom was happy because he loved the rain. He went out for a swim instead of sleeping in like he was suppose to.
